# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning and NLP techniques. The goal is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw text data from Twitter.
- Model training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
- Sentiment prediction: Predict the sentiment of new tweets using the trained model.
- Model deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, Streamlit (for deployment)

### Usage
#### Data Preparation:
- Collect Twitter data or use pre-collected datasets.
- Preprocess the data by cleaning, tokenizing, and lemmatizing the text.
#### Model Training:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) using the training data.
#### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#### Deployment:
- Deploy the trained model using Streamlit or any other web framework for real-time sentiment analysis.
